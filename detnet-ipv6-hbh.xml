      RFC 8938, the Deterministic Networking Data Plane Framework relies on the
      6-tuple to identify an IPv6 flow. But the full DetNet operations require
      also the capabilities to signal meta-information such as a sequence within
      that flow, and to transport different types of packets along the same path
      with the same treatment, e.g., Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
      packets and/or multiple flows with fate and resource sharing. This
      document introduces new IPv6 options that signal that path and redundancy
      information to the intermediate DetNet relay and forwarding nodes.

<t>
   Section 2 of the <xref target="RFC8557">Deterministic Networking Problem
   Statement</xref> introduces the concept of Deterministic Networking (DetNet)
   to the IETF. DetNet extends the reach of lower layer technologies such as
   Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) <xref target='IEEE8021TSN'/>
   and Timeslotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) <xref target='IEEE802154'/>
   over IPv6 and MPLS <xref target="RFC8938"/>, to provide bounded latency and
   reliability guarantees over an end-to-end layer-3 nailed-down path.
</t>
<t>
   The <xref target="RFC8655">"Deterministic Networking Architecture"</xref>
   details the contribution of layer-3 protocols, and defines three planes:
   the Application (User) Plane, the Controller Plane, and the Network Plane.
   <xref target="RFC8655"/> places an emphasis on the centralized model whereby
   a controller instantiates a DetNet state in the routers that is located based
   on matching information in the packet.
</t><t>
  The <xref target='RFC8938'>"Deterministic Networking Data Plane Framework"
  </xref> relies on the 6-tuple to identify an IPv6 flow. But the full DetNet
  operations require also the capabilities to signal meta-information such as
  a sequence within that flow, and to transport different types of packets
  along the same path with the same treatment. For instance, it is required that
  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) <xref target='RFC6291'/>
  packets and/or multiple flows share the same fate and resource sharing over
  the same Track or the same Traffic Engineered (TE) <xref target="RFC3272"/>
  DetNet path. This document proposes a layer-3 signaling that is independent
  of the upper layer information, to locate the DetNet state and enable the same
  forwarding nehavior for the data flows and the OAM packets.
</t><t>
   The <xref target="RFC9030">"6TiSCH Architecture"</xref> leverages RPL, the
   <xref target="RFC6550"> "Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks"
   </xref> and introduces concept of a Track as a highly redundant RPL
   Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) rooted at the Track
   Ingress. The Track is indicative of a layer-3 forwarding behavior (e.g., next
   hops)as opposed to indicative of the upper layer content, so it is more in
   line with the DetNet needs than the 6-tuple.
</t>
<t>
   A Track may for instance be installed using RPL route projection
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-dao-projection'/>. In that case, the TrackId is
   an index from a namespace associated to one IPv6 address of the Track Ingress
   node, and the Track that an IPv6 packet follows is signaled by the combination
   of the source address (of the Track Ingress node), and the TrackID placed in
   a RPL Option <xref target="RFC6553"/> located in an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop (HbH)
   Options Header <xref target="RFC8200"/> in the IPv6 packet.
</t>
<t>
   The <xref target='I-D.ietf-raw-architecture'> "Reliable and Available
   Wireless (RAW) Architecture"</xref>, extends the DetNet Network
   Plane to accomodate one or multiple hops of homogeneous or heterogeneous
   wireless technologies, e.g. a Wi-Fi6 Mesh or parallel radio access links
   combining Wi-Fi and 5G. The RAW Architecture reuses the concept of Track and
   introduces a new dataplane component, the Path Selection Engine (PSE), to
   dynamically select a subpath and maintain the required quality of service
   within a Track in the face of the rapid evolution of the medium properties.
</t>
<t>
   With <xref target="RFC8200"/>, the behavior of a router upon an IPv6 packet
   with a HbH Options Header has evolved, making the examination of the header
   by routers along the path optional, as opposed to previously mandatory.
   Additionally, the Option Type for any option in a HbH Options Header encodes
   in the leftmost bits whether a router that inspects the header should drop
   the packet or ignore the option when encountering an unknown option. Combined,
   these capabilities enable a larger use of the header beyond the boundaries of
   a limited domain, as examplified by the change of behavior of the RPL data
   plane, that was changed to allow a packet with a RPL option to escape the RPL
   domain in the larger Internet <xref target="RFC9008"/>.
</t>
<t><xref target="RFC8655"/> makes it clear that as opposed to the open Internet,
   the DetNet domain is a limited domain, in which it is possible to ensure that
   all routers support a certain functionality and can be configured by an
   harmonized set of management systems and controllers. As in a RPL domain, it
   is thus possible to deploy a solution that leverages new IPv6 EHs.
</t>
<t>
  <xref target='I-D.hinden-6man-hbh-processing'>"IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options
  Processing Procedures"</xref> further specifies the procedures for how IPv6
  HbH options are processed to make their processing even more practical
  and increase their use in the Internet. While the DetNet forwarding plane
  does not operate in the Internet at large, this illustrates that it can be
  realistic to consider IPv6 EHs and in particular the Hbh EH to transport
  DetNet information.
</t><t>
  As opposed to the HbH EH, the Destination Option Header (DOH) is only read
  by the destination of the packet, which can be one at a time the collection of
  nodes listed in a Routing Extension Header (RH) if the DOH is placed before
  the RH.
</t><t>
  This document introduces new IPv6 Options, the DetNet Redundancy Information
  Option and the DetNet Path Options, that signal the DetNet information to the
  intermediate DetNet nodes in an abstract form, that is pure layer-3 and
  agnostic of the transport layer. The options are placed in either a HbH EH or
  in a DOH, which happens when the next node that needs to process the option is
  the IPv6 destination in the IPv6 header.
</t><t>
  This pure layer-3 technique alines DetNet with the IPv6 architecture and opens
  to the progress / extensions done elsewhere for IPv6; e.g., if the DetNet path
  leverages Segment routing (SRv6) <xref target="RFC8402"/> for some reason
  - there are plausible ones in RAW -, the Segment Routing Header (SRH)
  <xref target="RFC8754"/> is inserted after the HbH and/or DOH by the PE
  and both are readily accessible for the on-path routers without the need of a
  deeper inspection of the packet (up to and beyond the transport header).
</t><t>
  For instance, the DetNet Redundancy Information Option may be placed in a DOH
  before an SRH that signals the exhaustive list of the DetNet relays along the
  path of the packet, so every relay can process the redundancy information
  therein, while the DetNet Strict Path Option would be placed in an HbH EH to
  be read by every DetNet forwarding node, and intercepted should it strays away
  from its path.

<t>The <xref target="RFC8939"> "Deterministic Networking (DetNet) Data Plane: IP"
   </xref> illustrates the need for DetNet Services at the IP network layer in
   conformance to the DetNet architecture <xref target="RFC8655"/> and data plane
   framework <xref target="RFC8938"/>). As the specification does not introduce
   a new header for DetNet, it also lacks the capability to signal PREOF at the
   network layer. Instead, the information of application flows (the 6-tuple),
   on which the network layer has no control, is used directly to makes network
   layer forwarding decisions. This confuses the signaling of the
   application-layer "water" that being transported and with the network-layer
   "pipe" that transports it and makes it problematic to aggregate applications
   flows and OAM for a equal treatment. It is thus desirable to introduce a
   new signaling to enable PREOF and flow aggregation independently of the
   application flow that is more appropriate for network layer operations.
</t>
<t><xref target='I-D.varga-detnet-ip-preof'/> provides a methods for signaling
   PREOF over UDP that combines the MPLS PREOF signaling defined in
   <xref target="RFC8964"> "DetNet Data Plane: MPLS" </xref> and the mechanisms
   defined in <xref target="RFC9025">"DetNet Data Plane: MPLS over UDP/IP"</xref>.
   This approach provides IP version independence, allows to reuse MPLS structures
   and possibly to bridge MPLS DetNet flows onto IP with minimal mapping effort.
   It is thus specially valuable in environments where flows can be transported
   in any combination of MPLS and IP. OTOH, the signaled information inherits
   the limitations of MPLS in terms of stack structure, and is available
   after the transport header, which can be harder to reach for a hardware
   solution, in particular in the presence of a variable header chain at the
   network layer.
</t>
<t>
   This draft proposes a native IPv6 solution that transports enriched DetNet
   PREOF information in IPv6 Extension Headers.
   This method reduces the encapsulation
   overhead, can be combined with the use of <xref target ="RFC8754">
   "IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6) Header (SRH)"</xref>, and simplifies the
   access to the PREOF data by placing it early in the network header chain.
   The forwarding information (the path) is advertised independently of the
   application flow information (observable as the 6-tuple). This enables any
   mix and match of flows and OAM data over the same path with the same
   treatment. The method is thus suited for environments that are IPv6-only,
   where flows can be aggregated over larger pipes and disaggregated again, but
   it is harder to combine with MPLS and requires that all nodes on path can
   parse at least the IPv6 Extension Header that signal the path.
</t>
<t>
   Transported in IPv6 Extension Headers, the DetNet options are easier to reach
   for a hardware or otherwise constrained implementation.
   A DetNet-aware end-system (see section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC8655"/>) may
   place the options in the header chain when constructing the packet, in which
   case there is no need of an encapsulation.
</t><t>
   Alternatively, the source end system may signal the flow information some
   other way, or it may lack the full DetNet awareness; in that case the DetNet
   path endpoints are the provider Edge (PE) routers (see <xref target=
   "fig5-8655"/> reproducing figure 5 of <xref target="RFC8655"/>) and the
  Ingress PE needs to encapsulate the packets to add the HbH options.
</t><t>
   In <xref target="fig5-8655"/>, the DetNet end systems may be f-aware and
   signal an IPv6 flow using the 6-tuple for the End-to-End service, but may not
   be s-aware, and may not sequence the packets for Packet Replication,
   Elimination, and Ordering Functions (PREOF), which operate at the detNet
   Service Layer. In that case, the Ingress PE will encapsulate the packets for
   this and possibly other flows to provide a common DetNet Service with OAM and
   PREOF, across the DetNet-1 service provider network, terminating the tunnel
   at the Egress PE router.

      <name>The DetNet Options</name>
    <!--  1111111111111111    -->
   <t>
   This document defines new IPv6 options for DetNet to signal path and a
   reliability information (e.g., sequencing) to the DetNet layers.
   Those options are to be placed in the IPv6 HbH Options Header, which is found
   right after the outer IPv6 header in the DetNet packet and immediately
   reachable for the forwarding engine.
   The format of the options follow the generic definition in section 4.2
   of <xref target="RFC8200"/>.
   For each tyoe of option, the draft allows to express the
   information in different fashions, depending on the use case, and possibly
   carrying an information that plays the same role at another layer, in which
   case the format of the information is opaque.
   </t>


   <t> The reliability
   information may be inherited from another layer as long as the value is
   guaranteed to be unique within a reasonable set of sequential packet so
   all packets with the same value are redundant.
   Timestamping can be used as an alternate sequencing technique, that avoids
   maintaining per-path state at the path ingress, which is feasible for nodes
   that maintain a very precise sense of time (e.g., from GPS or PTP) for their
   DetNet operations.
   As long as the time granularity is in the order of a few bytes transmission,
   the system timestamp provides an absolute sense of ordering over a very long
   period across all paths for which this node is ingress, and thus within any
   of those.
   Alternatively, the draft allows to combine a rough time stamp (e.g., from
   a system clock synchronized by NTP) and a sequence counter that differntiates
   the packets that are stamped within the timer resolution.
   </t>


   <t>
   If a DetNet Path option (see <xref target="detnetpatho"/>), including the RPL
   Option, is present in the same HbH Option Header as a DetNet Redundancy
   Information option (see <xref target="seqo"/>), then the redundancy
   information applies to the signaled path across all flows that traverse that
   path; else the redundancy information applies to the flow indicated by the
   6-tuple <xref target='RFC8938'/>.

   <t>
   The DetNet Redundancy Information Option helps discriminate copies of a same
   packet vs. different packets, and is useful for service-sublayer Packet
   Replication Elimination and Ordering Functions (PREOF). The option may be
   placed either in an HbH or a DoH EH, e.g., prior to a Segment Routing Header
   (SRH) <xref target='RFC8754'/> that lists the DetNet relays. A sequence
   counter is probably the most typical expression of the redundancy information,
   but it is not the only way to identify a packet and/or enable reordering, e.g.,
   a timestamp can be seen as a large sequence counter with gaps.
   </t>
   <t>
   It is also possible that a packet is divided in elements such as
   network-coded fragments. In that case, the pieces are discriminated with an
   opaque 8-bit fragment tag. The goal is to retain one copy of each fragment
   but not reorder them.
   </t>
   <t>
   A packet sequence can be expressed uniquely as a wrapping counter,
   represented as an unsigned integer in the option. In that case, the size of
   the representation MUST be large enough to cover at least 3 times the upper
   bound on out-of-order packet delivery in terms of number of packets.
   The sequence counter may be copied from a field in another protocol, and it
   is possible that the value 0 is reserved when wrapping, to the option offers
   both possibilities, wrapping to either 0 or to 1.
   </t>
   <t>
   This specification also allows to use a time stamp for the packet redundancy
   information, in conformance with the recommendations in <xref target="RFC8877"/>.
   This can be accomplished by utilizing the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
   format defined in IEEE Std. 1588 <xref target="IEEEstd1588" format="default"/>
   or Network Time Protocol (NTP) <xref target="RFC5905"/> formats.
   In that case, the timestamp resolution at the origin node that builds the option
   MUST be fine enough to ensure that two consecutive packets are never stamped
   with the same value. There is no requirement for this particular stamping
   function that the sense of time at the origin node is synchronized with the
   rest of the DetNet network.
   </t>
   <t>
   IEEEE TSN <xref target='IEEE8021TSN'/> defined a redundancy tag (R-Tag) for
   the IEEE Std. 802.1CB Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability (FRER).
   The R-Tag is a structured field and its content is subject to evolve; but the
   expectation for this specification is that the overall size remains 48 bits
   and that the 48-bit value is different for a large number of contiguous frames.
   When transporting TSN frames in a DetNet packet, it is possible to leverage
   the R-Tag as Redundancy information, though it cannot be assumed that the
   R-Tag is sequentially incremented; so it can be used for packet duplicate
   elimination but it is not suitable not for packet re-ordering.
   </t>
   <t>
   This specification also allows for an hybrid model with a coarse grained
   packet sequence within a coarse grained time stamp. In that case, both a
   time stamp option and a wrapping counter options are found, and the counter
   is used to compare packets with the same time stamp and ignored otherwise
   In that case, the size of the representation of the counter MUST be large
   enough to cover at least 3 times the number of packets that may be sent with
   the same value of time stamp.

      <name>DetNet Path Options</name>


   <t>
   The DetNet Architecture <xref target="RFC8655"/> assigns a DetNet flow
   "to specific paths through a network", but is not specific on how the path is
   then signaled in the packet. The DetNet Data Plane Framework <xref target="RFC8938"/> relies on the 6-tuple to identify an IPv6 flow and implicitely
   the path could be indexed by the flow identification. But this requires to
   maintain one path per flow and makes it difficult to assign other traffic
   such as OAM to the same path.
   </t>
   <t>This draft provides aditional means to signal the path in which
   the flow is placed separately from the flow indentification,
   and independantly of the transport layer, so a path can be shared between
   one or more flows and OAM packets across IP address families. All the packets
   that are assigned to the same path are subject to the same DetNet forwarding
   treatment.
   </t>

  <t>
   the DetNet expectation is that a PCE sets up a state at the DetNet forwarding
   sublayer to instruct each hop on how to process the DetNet flows.
   The DetNet Path Options when present contains information that MUST be used
   to select the DetNet state installed and if the DetNet state does not exist
   then the packet cannot be forwarded.
   </t>

   <section anchor="dpatho" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>DetNet Strict Path Option</name>


   <t>
   In complement to the RPL option, this specification defines a
   protocol-independent Strict Path Identifier, which is also taken from
   a namespace indicated by the IPv6 source address of the packet.
   </t>
   <t>
   The DetNet Strict Path Option is to be used in a limited domain
   to indicate a routing state that must be present in all nodes to ensure that
   the packet is routed along a strictly predefined path, for instance pointing
   at a specific next hop with reserved resources for buffers and bandwidth.
   For that reason all the routers along the path are expected to support the
   option and own a state indexed by the Strict Path ID indicated therein.
   </t>
   <t>
   The option is placed in an HbH EH to be seen by all routers on path.
   The path indicated therein may also be used by the service sublayer, to
   signal the scope where the redundancy information is unique across a number
   of packets large enough to ensure that a forwarding node never has to handle
   different packets with the same redundancy information, though the same
   value may be found for packets with a different path information.
   </t>
   <t>
   The typical DetNet path is typically contained under a single administrative
   control or within a closed group of administrative control; these include
   campus-wide networks and private WANs <xref target="RFC8655"/>.
   The typical expectation is that all nodes along a DetNet path are aware of
   the path and actively maintain a forwarding state for it. The DetNet Strict
   Path Option (see <xref target="dpatho"/>) is designed for that environment;
   if a packet escapes the local domain, a router that does not support the
   option will intercept it and return an error to the source.
   </t>
   <t>
   In other environments such as RAW, it might be that the service-layer
   protection concentrates on just segments of the end-to-end path.
   In that case, the service-sublayer protection may require the signaling of
   both redundancy and path information, though the path information is
   potentially not used by some of the intermediate routers and may not be used
   for forwarding at all. The path information may also relate to segments that
   are installed along the path using a DetNet forwarding state as opposed to,
   say, source routing.
   In either case the DetNet Loose Path Option <xref target="gpatho"/>
   can be used to signal the path without incurring an ICMP Error from an
   intermediate node.
   </t>
   <t>
   An intermediate router that supports the DetNet Strict Path Option but is
   missing the necessary state to forward along the indicated path must drop the
   packet and return an ICMP error.code 0 pointing at the offset of the
   Strict Path ID in the DetNet Strict Path Option.
    </t>
   <t>
   DetNet can also leverage the RPL Option that signals a Track in the RPL
   Packet Information (RPI) <xref target="RFC6553"/>. There are 2 versions of
   the RPL option, defined respectively in <xref target="RFC6550"/> with the act
   bits <xref target="RFC8200"/> set to dropped the packet when the option is
   unknown, that defined in<xref target="RFC9008"/> which let the option be
   ignored.

   <t>
   The DetNet Loose Path Option transports a Loose Path identifier which is
   taken from a namespace indicated by the Origin Autonomous System (AS). When
   the DetNet path is contained within a single AS, the Origin Autonomous System
   field can be left to 0 indicating local AS. The option may be
   placed either in an HbH or a DoH EH, but the preferred method is a DOH that
   precedes an RH such as SRH.
    </t>
   <t>
   The DetNet Loose Path Option is to be used to signal a path that may be
   loose and may exceed the boundaries of a local domain; a portion of the hops
   may traverse routers in the wider internet that will not leverage the option
   and are expected to ignore it. For instance, the path information may signal
   a specific topology in a multi-topology network and is only important for
   nodes that participate to more than one topology.
   </t>
   <t>
   An intermediate router that supports the DetNet Loose Path Option but is
   missing the necessary state to forward along the indicated path must ignore
   the DetNet Loose Path Option, but it should raise a management alert as
   this is an unexpected situation with a limited chance that the packet may
   loop till TTL.

        <t>
        The DetNet Strict Path Option is intended to be placed in an IPv6 HbH
        EH since it must be processed by every DetNet forwarding
        node along the path. The DetNet Loose Path Option and the DetNet
        Redundancy Information Option may also carried in an IPv6 HbH Option
        header the case where the set of routers that need the information
        does not match the destinations along a source route path; those options
        are intended to be ignored by unaware intermediate routers.

        In the
        specific case where path selection and PREOF are end-to-end performed
